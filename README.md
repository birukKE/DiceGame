#ðŸŽ² Thirty - A Dice Game in Kotlin
Thirty is a strategic dice game inspired by Yatzy, where players roll six dice over 10 rounds to maximize their score. Each round allows three rolls, with the ability to selectively reroll dice. The challenge? Choosing the best scoring categoryâ€”but each category can only be used once per game!
